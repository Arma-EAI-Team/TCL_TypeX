## What is T.C.L. TypeX ?

*Tactical Combat Link is an [Arma 3](http://www.arma3.com) AddOn written and maintained by* snkman, *one of the veteran coders of the community. From [the original thread](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/221659-tactical-combat-link-typex/) on bohemia forums* :

>Tactical Combat Link is a highly dynamic A.I. and F.X. enhancement modification for ARMA 3.
>
>Main focus of this modification is to enhance and improve A.I. in many different ways and situations.
>
>Tactical Combat Link gives mission designers full freedom about the control and behaviour of A.I. unit(s) and A.I. group(s) by providing multiple types and ways of how A.I. unit(s) and A.I. group(s) can be initialized and behave.
>
>Tactical Combat Link works as close as possible with the ARMA 3 engines natively A.I. behaviours to keep a good and clean A.I. mission flow.
>
>The main system and almost every feature of Tactical Combat Link use highly randomized values to create unique and varied combat situations.
>
>Tactical Combat Link was designed to be as realistic as possible!
>
>A.I. is able to react to each enemy player(s) ( playable / switchable ) individual which means it is possible to have Player(s) vs A.I. combat in almost every kind and situation.
>
>Each A.I. group has the ability to start their own reinforcement request cycle.
>
>A.I. unit(s) of Tactical Combat Link have been specialized and optimized for close and long range combat.
>
>Tactical Combat Link has been optimized by using some of the latest coding and syntax optimizations to provide solid and lag free missions.
